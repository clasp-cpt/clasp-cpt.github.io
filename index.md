## Parameterizing the effects of sub-grid land heterogeneity on the atmospheric boundary layer and convection

### Motivation

In existing climate models, simulated sub-grid heterogeneous states and fluxes over land are mostly disconnected from sub-grid parameterizations of the atmosphere. This is a recognized deficiency given the known role of multi-scale land heterogeneity in atmospheric processes including convection, rainfall initiation, and mesoscale circulations. 

### Objective 

Parameterize the heterogeneous sub-grid exchange between the land and atmosphere and characterize its implications for surface climate, variability, and extremes

### Tasks

* Implement a novel interaction scheme between the heterogeneous land and atmosphere in the DOE/E3SM, NOAA/ESM4, NASA/GEOS, and NCAR/CESM2 Earth system/climate models.
* Leverage and enhance coupling metrics to evaluate the modeling of heterogeneous land-atmosphere interactions.
* Evaluate and improve the parameterization using coupled land model/large eddy simulations and observations.
* Perform global simulations to gain understanding of the role of land spatial organization in the climate system.
